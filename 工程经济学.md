### Interest Rates & Economic Equivalence

#### Interest Rate

The cost of having money available for use or the *compensation* to the lender.

- Money has both earning power and purchasing power
- Interest rate should be higher than inflation rate
- Principal 本金
- The interest period 计息期
- Receipts 收入
- Simple Interest 单例
- Compound Interest 复利

#### Cash Flow Diagrams (学会画)

- 注意横轴不是无限延长的，按照年画
- 箭头长度代表比例
- 收入箭头向上，支出箭头向下
    - 注意结果全部放在年末，不能一项一项全都列出来（也不可能都列出来）

#### Economic Equivalence

Cash flows that have the same economic effect.

### Interest Formulas for Single Cash Flows

#### Uneven-payment Series

##### Compound-amount Fator 复利系数

$$F=P \times (1+i)^N=P\times (F/P, i, N)$$

Read as Find F, given P, i and N

后面那个式子可以直接查表

##### Present-worth Factor

$$P=F[1/(1+i)^N]=F(P/F, i, N)$$

#### Equal-payment Series

##### Compound-amount Factor

$$F=A(F/A, i, N)$$

##### Sinking-fund Fator

$$A=F(A/F,i,N)$$

##### Capital-recovery Factor

$$A=P(A/P,i,N)$$

##### Present-worth Factor

$$P=A(P/A,i,N)$$
